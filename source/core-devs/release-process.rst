Release process
===============

Red's release process involves a bit of work. This document attempts to collect,
in one place, all the steps needed to make a release of Red.

Types of releases
-----------------

- Breaking release (``3.x+1.0``)

  Release with breaking changes, done from ``V3/develop``.

- Standard release (``3.x.y+1``)

  Release without breaking changes that may contain both features and bugfixes.

  This is done from ``V3/develop`` or ``3.x`` branch
  if a breaking release is currently in development.

- Maintenance release (``3.x.y+1``)

  Release without breaking changes that only contains cherry-picked enhancements and bugfixes.

  Quite similar to a standard release but it is done from a short-lived release branch
  using the tag of a previous version as a base.

- Hotfix release (``3.x.y+1``)

  Release that is meant to quickly patch one of the currently supported releases
  (usually it is just the latest).

  This is done from a short-lived release branch using the tag of a previous version as a base,
  or from ``V3/develop``/``3.x`` if it doesn't contain any meaningful code changes yet.


Making a release
----------------

#. Ensure there are no release blockers.

   .. tab:: Hotfix release

      You can *generally* skip this. Might still be worth checking
      in case there is some blocker related to release workflow that could potentially affect you.

   .. tab:: Everything else

      Look at the milestone for the next release and check if there are any Release Blockers
      (labelled as "Release Blocker" on the issue tracker) that need to be handled before the release.

#. Check state of all open pull requests for this milestone.

   .. tab:: Hotfix release

      This is a hotfix release, you should focus on getting the critical fix out,
      the other PRs should not be important. However, you should still update the milestone
      to make your and others' job easier later.

   .. tab:: Everything else

      Decide which should be kept for the release, cooperate with another org member(s) on this.
      Move any pull requests not targeted for release to a new milestone with name of the release
      that should come after current one.

#. Review changelog PR.

   .. note::

      At this point, you should have an up-to-date milestone containing all PRs
      that are contained in this release. If you're not sure if all PRs are properly assigned,
      you might find the ``=getunreleasedcommits MILESTONE_NAME`` bot command
      in one of testing channels on Red server useful.

   The changelog PR should always be merged into ``V3/develop``. You should remember to later
   cherry-pick/backport it to a proper branch if you're not making a release from ``V3/develop``.

   .. tab:: Hotfix release

      Hotfix releases need to contain a changelog.

      It can be limited to a short description of what the hotfix release fixes, for example see:
      `Red 3.4.12 changelog <https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/changelog_3_4_0.html#redbot-3-4-12-2021-06-17>`__

   .. tab:: Everything else

      - Add (or ask PR author to add) any missing entries based on the release's milestone.
      - Update the contributors list in the changelog using contributors list for the milestone
        that you can generate using ``=getcontributors MILESTONE_NAME`` bot command
        in one of testing channels on Red server.
      - Merge the PR once it's ready.

#. Run "Prepare Release" workflow.

   Go to https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/actions/workflows/prepare_release.yml

   .. tip::

      This step only takes care of automatically creating some PRs,
      it won't release anything, don't worry!

   - Click on the "Run workflow" button
   - Choose the long-lived branch for the version you're releasing

     This is either ``V3/develop`` or ``3.x`` branch that you will be cherry-picking changes from,
     not the short-lived release branch.

   - Click on the "Run workflow" button in the popover

   .. figure:: /_images/prepare-release-workflow.png
      :target: /_images/prepare-release-workflow.png

#. Merge the automatically created PRs.

   Wait for "Prepare Release" workflow to finish and merge the PRs that it created.

#. Create a short-lived release branch.

   .. tab:: Hotfix release

      .. note::

         This does not apply if you're releasing from the long-lived branch
         (i.e. ``V3/develop`` or ``3.x``).

      - Create a branch named ``V3/release/VERSION_TO_RELEASE_HERE`` based off
        a tag of previous version.

        This can be done with the command:

        .. prompt::

            git checkout -b V3/release/VERSION_TO_RELEASE_HERE PREVIOUS_VERSION

      - Cherry-pick the critical fix, the changelog, the automated PRs, and the version bump.
      - Push the branch to upstream repository (Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)

        With a typical setup where ``upstream`` remote points to upstream repository
        and ``origin`` points to user's fork, this can be done with the command:

        .. prompt::

            git push -u upstream V3/release/VERSION_TO_RELEASE_HERE

   .. tab:: Maintenance release

      - Create a branch named ``V3/release/VERSION_TO_RELEASE_HERE`` based off
        a tag of previous version.

        This can be done with the command:

        .. prompt::

            git checkout -b V3/release/VERSION_TO_RELEASE_HERE PREVIOUS_VERSION

      - Cherry-pick the relevant changes, the changelog, the automated PRs, and the version bump.
      - Push the branch to upstream repository (Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)

        With a typical setup where ``upstream`` remote points to upstream repository
        and ``origin`` points to user's fork, this can be done with the command:

        .. prompt::

            git push -u upstream V3/release/VERSION_TO_RELEASE_HERE

   .. tab:: Breaking or standard release

      This does not apply.

   .. _write-announcement:

#. Write (not send!) an announcement for the new release.

   This is the announcement that you will later `post to Discord <publish-announcement>`.

   Remember to:

   - Mention that the changelog contains "Read before updating" section (if applicable):

     .. code:: markdown

         __**Before you update**: please ensure that you read the “Read before updating” section in the changelogs first.__

   - Include the link to changelog.

     .. note::

         - Use link to ``stable`` or tagged (i.e. ``3.4.0``) version of docs,
           DO NOT USE link to ``latest``.
         - The changelog link should point to the section for the specific release
           (the part after ``#`` in the URL)

         For example:

         .. code:: markdown

            Full changelogs here: <https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/changelog_3_4_0.html#redbot-3-4-12-2021-06-17>

#. Make a new release through `GitHub Releases <https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/releases/new>`.

   .. attention::

      Remember to change the target branch when you're not releasing from ``V3/develop``!

   - Put the version number as tag name (i.e. ``3.4.0``)
   - Put the version number prepended with "v" as release title (i.e. ``v3.4.0``)
   - Ensure that the target branch is selected correctly
   - Write a short release description

     The description can be informal, the changelog has all the important information already.
     Be sure to put a link to full changelog from our docs in release description.

     The changelog link should point to the section for the specific release
     (the part after ``#`` in the URL), e.g.:

     .. code:: markdown

         Full changelog: https://docs.discord.red/en/latest/changelog_3_4_0.html#redbot-3-4-12-2021-06-17

   .. figure:: /_images/drafting-new-release.png
      :target: /_images/drafting-new-release.png

#. Check the correctness of Release information and approve or reject the environment run.

   .. danger::

      This is the step when the new version will get published.

      At this point you should already have `written the announcement <write-announcement>`
      that you will be sending after this is done.

   Go to https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/actions/workflows/publish_release.yml

   - Click on the first workflow run (with a clock icon) on the list.

   .. figure:: /_images/publish-release-workflow-list.png
      :target: /_images/publish-release-workflow-list.png

   - Click on the "GO HERE BEFORE APPROVING" job.
   - Expand the "REVIEW OUTPUT OF THIS STEP BEFORE APPROVING" step.
   - **Verify the release information printed in the step is correct.**

   .. figure:: /_images/publish-release-job.png
      :target: /_images/publish-release-job.png

   - Go back to Summary, click on "Review deployments" and approve or reject the environment run.

#. Wait for the CI to finish its job.

   "Publish Release" workflow needs to finish before you can continue.
   You should also wait for the ``stable`` build on the Read The Docs to finish if it hasn't already.

   .. _publish-announcement:

#. Send and publish an announcement in Discord.

   This is the announcement that you wrote in `the earlier step <write-announcement>`.

#. Merge the PR bumping to dev version.

   It should have been automatically created during "Publish release" workflow
   that you approved earlier.

#. Close release milestone and create a new one.

   Close the milestone for the release that was just made
   and create an appropriately named milestone for the next release.

After all this is done, you can enjoy the new release
(or make a hotfix if there's a critical issue, let's hope there's not though :))
